# ACM-for-OpenShift
This project is part of the IoT Project that Nokia and Metropolia UAS are working on. This is just a fraction of a much larger project of creating a data center.
This project will last for 16 weeks with the final week being the 3rd week in march 2025.
The main aim of this project is to create an Advance Cluster Management system for OpenShift clusters. The idea is that, this will give a maximum capacity to administrators to be able to manage the data centers from a single interface.
